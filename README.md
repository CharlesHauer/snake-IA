# Snake Rules

## 1. Objetive:
* The objective of the Snake game is to control the movement of a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.
## 2. Contols:
* Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake's movement.
## 3. Gameplay:
* The game starts with a single segment snake appearing on the screen.
* The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing at a constant speed.
* Your task is to navigate the snake to eat the food items that appear on the screen.
* Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer by one segment.
* The game continues until the snake collides with the boundaries of the game screen or with itself.
## 4. Obstacles:
* Be cautious of the walls surrounding the game area. Colliding with them will end the game.
* Additionally, avoid running into the snake's own body. If the snake collides with itself, the game is over.
## 5. Scoring:
* Points are earned each time the snake eats a piece of food.
* The longer the snake becomes, the higher the score will be.
## 6. Difficulty:
* As the game progresses and the snake grows longer, it becomes increasingly challenging to avoid collisions with obstacles.
## 7. Game Over:
* The game ends when the snake collides with either the walls or itself.
* After the game ends, players can view their final score and may choose to replay the game to try to achieve a higher score.
